# hw03-password-generator
First submission of password generator.

Created a function in js what will take down user parameters to generate a passowrord.

Application will promt user for

* Password Length between 8-128 characters.

* To confirm to inclulde letters.

* To confirm to inclulde numbers.

* To confirm to inclulde special characters.

The application was working but I'm not sure if I didn't commit it or if I didn't save it but this is the most recent save I could find. I will have to redo the function and resubmit the assignment once I get it working again.
